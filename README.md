# Human-Activity-Recognition-Using-WISDM-Dataset
 I Designed a Human Activity Recognition system using the WISDM dataset by analyzing smartphone sensor data i.e accelerometer readings along X, Y, Z axes.
 <br>
 I Performed complete data preprocessing including cleaning, standardization, and feature engineering (e.g magnitude calculation).
 <br>
 Conducted detailed EDA to visualize patterns and statistical differences between activities like walking and jogging.
 <br>
I Implemented and compared machine learning models like KNN, SVM (with different kernels), and K-Means clustering to classify and group activities.
 <br>
Also, I Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices to determine the most effective approach.
